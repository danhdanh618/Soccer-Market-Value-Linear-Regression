    "# Soccer Player Market Value Prediction – Project Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This project explores predicting soccer players’ market values using performance statistics from various seasons. The main goal is to understand how measurable on-field performance can explain or estimate a player’s monetary value in the transfer market.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "- Predict the market value of top soccer players based on key performance metrics.  \n",
    "- Compare predicted values to actual market values to identify patterns and discrepancies.  \n",
    "- Analyze the effect of prime seasons versus less productive seasons on market valuation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Data\n",
    "\n",
    "- Player data sourced from `soccer_player.csv`.  \n",
    "- Seasons analyzed include Messi 2011-2012, Messi 2019-2020, Ronaldo 2017-2018, Ronaldo 2019-2020, Lewandowski 2019-2020, and Harry Kane 2019-2020.  \n",
    "- Features used in the model:\n",
    "  - xG Per Avg Match  \n",
    "  - Shots, OnTarget  \n",
    "  - Shots Per Avg Match, On Target Per Avg Match  \n",
    "  - Goals, Goals per Shot, Assists  \n",
    "  - Passes Completed, Assisted Shots, Touches  \n",
    "  - Height, Games Started, Minutes Played  \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** `passes_blocked` was not included due to missing data for several players.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **linear regression model** was implemented using gradient descent from scratch.  \n",
    "- Players’ feature vectors were normalized using mean and standard deviation from the dataset.  \n",
    "- Predictions were computed and compared against actual market values.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Key Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Prime seasons** result in higher predicted market values due to strong statistics (e.g., Messi 2011-2012, Ronaldo 2017-2018).  \n",
    "- The model tends to **overestimate market values** when a player has exceptional goal-scoring efficiency but lower context-based metrics like assists or passes.  \n",
    "- The model tends to **underestimate market values** for shorter seasons or injury-affected seasons (e.g., Harry Kane 2019-2020).  \n",
    "- Metrics like R², MAE, RMSE, and MAPE indicate moderate predictive performance, which is reasonable given the linear nature of the model and limited features.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Limitations & Future Work\n",
    "\n",
    "- Only linear regression was used; other models (e.g., random forest, XGBoost, or neural networks) may capture non-linear relationships better.  \n",
    "- Important contextual features like team influence, competition level, and key match performance are missing.  \n",
    "- Expanding the dataset to include more seasons and players could improve model accuracy.  \n",
    "- Visualization of predictions vs. actual values helps identify over- and under-estimations clearly.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Deliverables\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Plots** comparing predicted vs. actual market values for top players.  \n",
    "- **Markdown reports** summarizing predictions, observations, and analysis.  \n",
    "- **Evaluation metrics** to quantify model performance.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Model Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "The following metrics were calculated on the dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **R² Score:** 0.438  \n",
    "- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** 15,841,811.81 Euros  \n",
    "- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** 21,637,107.99 Euros  \n",
    "- **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE):** 336.31%  \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Observation:** The linear model captures some trends but struggles with extreme values (e.g., prime seasons), explaining why high-performing players like Messi 2011-2012 have predicted values far above actual market value.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This project provides a foundation for understanding how performance metrics translate into market value and serves as a stepping stone for more advanced player valuation models.\n",
